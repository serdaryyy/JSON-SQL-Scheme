# Cybersecurity Services Infrastructure (CSI)

CSI is a distributed (service-oriented) infrastructure ***intended solely for 
educational purposes*** (and should never be used in a production environment).

At the core is a generic REST server that accepts server specifications,
which are then executed to start what we call **subservers**.
**IMPORTANT NOTE**: this server accepts and executes executable
JavaScipt code. This approach is suitable in our context of education,
but should never be used in a production environment.

The file launcher.js launches a number of services, including

* YellowPages: a subscription service where services can find eachother
	* provide: here, a server describes a service that it offers.
	* require: here, a server describes all services that it needs.  
		For each required service, the requestor will receive a /fulfill message describing  
		a provider (either immediately or as soon as the service is 'provided')
* IDManager: a service persisting user names and hashed passwords
	* verify: check if the offered credentials are bona fide
* AccessManager: a service which checks access rights/roles
	* verify: checks if a user has the required right/role
* Login: allows users to log in on HTML pages
	* keyexchange: create secure communication (shared secret)
	* login: secure login

## Getting Started

See generic info on cloning a github repo

### Prerequisites

Recent node.js, see [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)

e.g. download Win msi, Mac pkg or tarball

### Installing
npm install hapi
npm install request-promise
npm install request

Step one: start the generic server by `node genericServer.js` (if your `node` is called `node`
Step two: execute launcher by `node launcher.js`
Step three: visit `jsoneditor.html` and press `login`

(currently jsoneditor has dummy data and doesn't do much
